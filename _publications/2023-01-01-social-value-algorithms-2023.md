Value Sensitive Design (VSD) is a theory that focuses on embedding ethical values into algorithmic regimes. This research paper examines the mechanism of VSD and its effects in platform-based technology, using a multi-step approach that comprises mixed novel methods such as real-time, high frequency social media data analysis combined with statistical regressions and csQCA. The goal was to establish causal knowledge of investigated variables and provide empirical advice for platform companies.
